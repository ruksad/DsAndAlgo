1. Graph algorithms: BSTs can be used to implement graph algorithms, such as in minimum spanning tree algorithms.
2. Priority Queues: BSTs can be used to implement priority queues, where the element with the highest priority is at the root of the tree, and elements with lower priority are stored in the subtrees.
3. Self-balancing binary search tree: BSTs can be used as a self-balancing data structures such as AVL tree and Red-black tree.
5. Data storage and retrieval: BSTs can be used to store and retrieve data quickly, such as in databases, where searching for a specific record can be done in logarithmic time.
